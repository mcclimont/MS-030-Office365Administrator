		.\CreateProblemUsers.ps1


 **Note:** Wait until the script has completed before proceeding to the next step. 

5. This Windows PowerShell script will make the following changes in AD DS:

- Klemen Sic. Add the "@" character to the beginning of "Adatum" for the **UserPrincipalName** attribute.

- Lara Raisic. Replace the existing string with "lara@Adatum.com" for the **emailAddress** attribute.

- Logan Boyle. Replace the existing string with “lara@Adatum.com” for the **emailAddress** attribute.

- Holly Spencer. Replace the existing string with “holly @Adatum.com” for the **EmailAddress** attribute.

6. Maj Hojski. Replace the existing string with “ “ for the **emailAddress** attribute.

## Task 3: Run the IdFix tool and fix identified issues

1. On LON-CL1, open Microsoft Edge, and then connect to **https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36832**

2. On the IdFix DirSync Error Remediation Tool page, Select **Download**.

3. Wait for the download to complete, and then Select **Open**.

4. In the File Explorer windows, browse to the **Downloads** folder, right-Select **IdFix.zip**, and then Select **Extract All...**

5. In the **Extract Compressed (Zipped) Folders** dialog box, in the destination box, type **C:\Deployment Tools\IdFix**, and then Select **Extract**.

6. In File Explorer, in the **C:\Deployment Tools\IdFix** folder, right-Select **IdFix**, and then Select **Run as administrator**.

7. In the User Account Control dialog box, Select **Yes**.

8. In the **IdFix Privacy Statement** message box, Select **OK**.

9. Select **Query**. You should see several errors. 

10. Select the **ERROR** column to sort the character errors to the top of the list.

 **Note:** Ignore topleveldomain errors, which cannot be fixed by the IdFix tool.

11. In the Klemen Sic row, in the **ACTION** column, select **EDIT**.

12. In the Holly Spencer row, in the **ACTION** column, select **EDIT.** 

13. In the Maj Hojski row, in the **ACTION** column, select **EDIT**

14. On the toolbar, Select **Apply**.

15. In the **Apply Pending** dialog box, Select **Yes**; note the **COMPLETE** status in the **ACTION** column indicating successful writes.

17. Switch back to the IdFix tool.

18. On the toolbar, Select **Query**. 

19. Select in the **UPDATE** column to locate the Logan Boyle error, and replace the string with **logan@Adatum.com**, and then in the **ACTION** column, select **EDIT**.

20. Select in the **UPDATE** column to locate the Maj Hojski error, and replace the string with **maj@Adatum.com**, and then in the **ACTION** column, select **EDIT**.

21.  On the toolbar, Select **Apply**.

22. In the **Apply Pending** box, Select **Yes**.

23. On the toolbar, Select **Query** and verify that errors are corrected.

 **Note:** Where there are format and duplicate errors for distinguished names, the UPDATE column either contains the same string as the VALUE column, or the UPDATE column entry is blank; in either case, this means that IdFix cannot suggest a remediation for the error.

You can either fix these errors outside IdFix, or manually remediate them within IdFix. You can also export the results and use Windows PowerShell to remediate a large number of errors.

## Task 4: Configure the Office 365 tenant for directory synchronization

15. In the **Groups** list, select the Project Team group.

 **Note:** In the right pane, notice that **Edit Members** is unavailable. This is because group membership is maintained by Active Directory. To view the membership, you need to use Windows PowerShell.

16. On LON-DS1, in Windows PowerShell, type the following command, and then press Enter:


		Get-MsolGroup


17. Verify that you see Research and Project Team groups. Copy the ObjectID value for these two groups.

18. To verify that you updated the group membership in AD DS, type the following command at the Windows PowerShell prompt, and then press Enter:


		Get-MsolGroupMember –GroupObjectId <ObjectID for Research group>


19. Verify the membership of the group does not contain the users removed in AD DS. The users who were removed from the group are:

	- Claire Roberson

	- Connie Vaughn

	- Esther Wiggins

20. To verify that you have moved the user, Vera Pace, out of the scope of synchronization, type the following command at the Windows PowerShell prompt, and then press Enter:


		get-MsolUser –Search Vera


21. At the Windows PowerShell prompt, type the following command, and then press Enter:


		Get-MsolAccountSku


 **Note:** The number of **ConsumedUnits** is now less than before.

22. Leave the virtual machines running for the next lab. 

 


**Results**: After completing this exercise, you will have identified how managing user and group accounts has changed with directory synchronization.
